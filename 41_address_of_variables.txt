Section 05: Address of Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	Write a program to print the address of variables

		int myData;

	&myData --> gives you memory location address of 
	myData variable

	%p --> formate specifier to print a memory address
	(aka a pointer)

	The pointer (memory location address) size is compiler
	and hardware specific. Later when we explore the ARM
	Cortex Mx based STM32 Microcontroller, you will se that
	the pointer size is of 4 bytes
